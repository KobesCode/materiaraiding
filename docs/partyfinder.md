# Find a Static

A **Static** is a group of players who regularly play together, often for high-end content like Ultimate and Savage raids. A static party can help you progress through content faster and more reliably if you can commit to a regular schedule.

Use the listings below or visit the channels in the **Materia Raiding Discord** to create your own static party.
