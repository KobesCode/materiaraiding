The raid features multiple bosses and small-scale encounters, requiring a large group of players to complete. The raid is designed for up to 56 players but can be entered with a minimum of 8 players should they still meet the entry requirements.

The Baldesion Arsenal is part of **The Forbidden Land: Eureka Hydatos** and will require completing several prerequisites before players can access it.

## Zone Overview

Eureka allows players to progress their character's power in **many different ways**, each serving to help the player in both the multiple zones and inside The Baldesion Arsenal.

They are not strictly required to clear the raid but are generally reccomended if you have lots of gil and/or plan to spend a lot of time in Eureka zones.

### Logos Actions

Logos actions, first introduced in Pyros, allows use of up to **2 specialised actions** at any time that have various, powerful effects.

To obtain and equip them players must first acquire the neccessary **logograms** which can be dropped by mobs, Notorious Monster FATEs, found in coffers and also purchased off the Marketboard. Afterwards, you can speak with **Drake** to appraise them, and finally combine them at the **Logos Manipulator** to create the actions.

To see a complete table of Logos actions, along with their effects, recipes and logogram aquisitions, please see the website below.

<Action title='Logos Actions List' color='purple' href='https://ffxiv-eureka.com/logograms' />

### Aethertight Flasks

Aethertight Flasks are items dropped from **Silver Happy Bunny Coffers only** within Hydatos that serve to increase the amount of Logos action slots available to the player.

**Up to 3** can be used by speaking with the **Expedition Alchemist** in the base camp of Hydatos, for a **maximum of 6** total Logos action slots.

### 6th and 7th Magicites

Certain Notorious Monsters within both Pyros and Hydatos have a **very rare chance** to drop a unique material.

You must obtain one of each unique material availble within each zone and speak with the **Expedition Engineer** located within each base camp to earn your 6th and 7th magicites. You may also purchase these materials off the Marketboard.

Below is a table listing the name of the unique material and the Notorious Monster FATE it drops from.

| **Pyros** | **Hydatos** |
| :---: | :---: |
| Lamebrix's Dice <br> (**Thirty Whacks**) | Molech's Horn <br> (**Bullheaded Berserker**) |
| Ying Yang's Tissue <br> (**Haunter of the Dark**) | Goldemar's Horn <br> (**Duty-free**) |
| Skoll's Claw <br> (**Heavens' Warg**) | Ceto's Claw <br> (**Stone-cold Killer**) |


### Cassie Earring, Blitzring and Optical Hat

Certain Notorious Monsters within Pagos have a **very rare chance** to drop a piece of gear that increases the player's **Haste** stat, with each point being a **~1% additive increase** in skill speed and spell speed.

Both the Cassie Earring and Blitzring are available as rare drops, whereas the Optical hat can be obtained by collecting an assortment of items across Pagos and crafting them into a singular item, then completing the requisite FATE. All these items are also purchasable on the marketboard.

These items are **extremely rare, expensive and optional** for only a minor increase in damage (if your job directly benefits with more skill/spell speed).

### Elemental +2 Sets and Physeos Weapons

Elemental +2 Sets and Physeos Weapons are obtainable gear that offer substantial increases in universal offense and defense by increasing your **Elemental Bonus** stat.

The Elemental sets are first available from Pyros, and requires players to fulfull **2 conditions** to unlock the **Expedition Artisan** in the Pyros base camp:
1. Obtain an **Elemental stage weapon**.
2. Discover **50 Logos actions**.

The sets can then be augmented with the **Expedition Artisan** in the Hydatos base camp, first to +1 with **Hydatos Crystals** and finally to +2 with **Eureka Fragments**, dropped from The Baldesion Arsenal.

To upgrade your weapon to a Physeos Weapon, you must exchange both your **Eureka stage weapon** and **100 Eureka Fragments** with **Gerolt** in the Hydatos base camp.

### Kirin's and Vermillion Chestpieces

Kirin's and Vermillion chestpieces also offer a substantial increase in **Elemental Bonus** and **Haste**.

Kirin's and Vermillion chestpieces are available for exchange with the **Nostalgic Fellow** in Kugane using **Cryptic Seals** and **Damascene Cloth**, both obtainable within The Baldesion Arsenal. You may also buy the armor, seals and cloths off the Marketboard.

This visual guide details the entry requirements, party and Logos action setup and boss abilities and potential callouts. The guide also features the trash mobs between each boss, trap zones and loot.

<Action title='Visual Guide' color='red' href='https://puu.sh/HSjBs/2c2182fc1d.png' />

### Entry Requirments

Any player who is **Elemental Level 60** and has completed all story objectives in Hydatos may enter The Baldesion Arsenal. You must also speak with the **Expedition Scholar** in the base camp of Hydatos to unlock the raid.

To enter The Baldesion Arsenal, a minimum of 8 players must have met the above prerequisites in order to spawn the **Umbral Turbulence** weather and the following Notorious Monster FATE: **I Don't Want to Believe**.

::: info I Don't Want to Believe
**Dispel L** is required to remove any personal buffs the Notorious Monster gives itself.
:::

Only **Elemental Level 60** players that obtain a **Gold Rating** on the FATE will recieve the **Aetherially Primed** buff for 10 minutes, allowing them to access any portals to The Baldesion Arsenal that spawn after the FATE has concluded.

There are two kinds of portals that appear.

1. A **blue unstable** portal that requires the use of an **Aetheric Stabilizer** to access.
2. A **red stable** portal that appears a few minutes after the blue portals have appeared.

::: tip Finding a Group
Two major communities support Field Operations in OCE, the **Content Achievers** Discord covers a wide variety of content including Field Operations, while **Murder of Geese (MOG)** Discord focuses specifically on Field Operations Raids and coordinating groups.

### Set Up
::: info NOTE
The nature of **Logos actions** allows players to take on other roles to cover any missing bases of tanking, healing and damage.
:::

Each party should aim for:

- **x1** Tank
- **x2** Healers
- **x5** DPS

**Extra tanks and healers** are welcome should the whole raid not have enough players to clear comfortably or needs a safety net for Ozma.

Additionally, everyone should have a **Spirit of the Remembered** buff active **AT ALL TIMES**, available from the Logos action of the same name. It offers you a **70% chance** to be automatically revived if you die, a very useful tool to circumnavigate the restriction on standard raises. **If it gets consumed**, find a safe moment to refresh your buff, even during battle.

Depending on your role, it's useful to have certain **Wisdoms** active in order to further amplify your role in the raid, these are:

| **Main Tank** | **Off Tank** | **Pure Healer** | **Barrier Healer** | **Melee DPS** | **Phys. Ranged DPS** | **Caster DPS** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Indomitable or Guardian| Martialist | Aetherweaver | Ordained or Aetherweaver | Duelist or Skirmisher | Fiendhunter or Skirmisher | Elder or Skirmisher|

Finally, at least a couple players should have the Logos action **Perception L** to uncover any **traps** littered throughout the raid as well as the **portal** leading to the secret rooms.

### Encounters

#### Boss 1 - Art and Owain

**Art** and **Owain** are located in seperate rooms and have no strict enrage, but they must **both** be engaged in combat at the same time and reach 1 HP to be defeated.

**Art** can be found through the **West** hallway and **Owain** can be found through the **East** hallway.

::: details Art
**Art** is **Earth aspected**, so adjust your Magia Board to **Earth** for defense or **Water** for offense.

**Art** will begin the fight with the following sequence:

1. **Thricecull** - A tankbuster.

2. **Two** unique casts of **Legendcarver** and **Legendspinner** - A PB-AoE and Donut respectively.

3. **Acallum no Senorach** - A raidwide.

4. **Mythcall** - Summons **four** spears around the arena that mimic the **Legendcarver** or **Legendspinner** the boss uses.
    > Players should first dodge the original cast, then dodge that same attack from the spears' locations.

5. **Acallum no Senorach**

6. **Thricecull**

7. **Mythcall**

8. **Legendary Geas** - Targets a player with an avoidable AoE and turns the floor black in colour.
    > Players moving while the floor is darkened will be inflicted with a **Bleed** and **Heavy**. This is followed by multiple line AoEs that become difficult to dodge if you have **Heavy**.

9. **Acallum no Senorach**

10. **Pitfall** and **Glory Unearthed** - The boss will jump away, creating a proximity AoE where it lands and targeting a player with a large chasing AoE.
    > The targeted player must bait the AoEs away from both the party and the proximity AoE.

From here, **Art** will enter a loop of attacks until it's defeated, only adding in **Piercing Dark**, a targeted AoE on **two** players.
:::

::: details Owain
**Owain** is both **Fire and Ice aspected**, so adjust your Magia board to **Fire and Ice** respectively for defense or **Wind and Fire** respectively for offense.

**Owain** will begin the fight with the following sequence:

1. **Thricecull** - A tankbuster.

2. **Acallum no Senorach** - A raidwide.

3. **Mythcall** - Summons **eight** spears around the arena that become **Fire or Ice aspected** in the following cast.

4. **Elemental Shift** - **Owain** shifts its own element and the spears around itself to either **Fire or Ice**.

5. **Elemental Magicks** - A telegraphed PB-AoE that also casts from any spears that are the same element as the boss.
    > Players should position at a spear of the opposite element of **Owain**.

6. **Thricecull**

7. **Acallum no Senorach**

8. **Elemental Shift**

9. **Elemental Magicks**

10. **Thricecull**

11. **Spiritcull** - **Two** players are marked with a targeted AoE and **several** other players are marked with **red triangles**.
    > Any player with a **red triangle** mark should pair up with another marked player.

12. **Thricecull**

13. **Acallum no Senorach**

14. **Pitfall** and **Piercing Light** - The boss will jump away, creating a proximity AoE where it lands and targeting **two** players with a targeted AoE.

15. **Hands** - Multiple targetable hands will spawn around the arena, **tethering** to a player. These hands will slowly move towards the player and **freeze** in place if being looked at by its tethered player. They also have a damage resistance buff that can be removed by being in close proximity of its tethered player.
    > **Tethered** players should look at their hand and move towards it to remove its buff, making sure not to touch it directly.
    >> Everyone else can wait until the buff is removed before DPS'ing them down.

From here, **Owain** will enter a loop of attacks until it's defeated.
:::

#### Boss 2 - Raiden

**Raiden** also has no strict enrage, but still has attacks that can **instantly kill** any players not paying attention.

**Raiden** is **Lightning** aspected, so adjust your Magia board to **Lightning** for defense and **Earth** for offense.

**Raiden** will begin the fight with the following sequence:

1. **Spirits of the Fallen** - A raidwide.

2. **Shingan** - A tankbuster.

3. **Thundercall** - Creates a bleed wall along the outer edge of the arena.

**Raiden** will then cycle through **two** attacks until its HP reaches 69%:

1. **Ame-no-Sakahoko**, a massive untelegraphed PB-AoE centered on itself as well as a large backflip, landing a considerable distance behind where the boss is facing.
2. **Whirling Zantetsuken**, a massive untelegraphed donut with the only safespot being directly under the hitbox. 

::: tank
If you're the current MT, position **Raiden** at the wall at the beginning of the fight so that the boss has ample space to backflip.
:::

Upon passing the threshhold, **Raiden** will disappear and reappear at the **East** or **West** of the arena, becoming untargetable and casting **Lateral Zantetsuken**, a half-room cleave dictated by the direction its sword is pointing towards.

Additionally, multiple untargetable **Ball Lightning** adds will spawn under players and begin casting **Shock**, a telegraphed PB-AoE.

To resolve this, all players should stack up in the middle after **Raiden** disappears and look for the boss on either side of the arena to watch the sword. When the AoEs appear, players can start running **away** from the direction the sword is pointing towards.

**Raiden** will reappear, casting another **Spirits of the Fallen** and then **Lancing Bolt**, targeting **six** random players with a massive spread AoE.

Each **Lancing Bolt** AoE will spawn a **Streak Lightning**, a **Lightning** aspected add that renders **Raiden** invulnerable while it begins casting **Ultimate Zantetsuken**, an enrage that wipes the party if the cast finishes. All players must DPS down the **Streak Lightnings** before **Raiden** can finish casting **Ultimate Zantetsuken**.

From here, **Raiden** will begin a loop of attacks both old and new:

1. **Spirits of the Fallen**

2. **Booming Lament** - A large telegraphed AoE targeted on a player.

3. **Cloud to Ground** - **Two** waves of **exaflares** that spawn along the outer edges of the arena.
    > Players can position in the 2nd wave of **exaflares**, then move into the 1st wave as the AoEs travel along the arena.

4. **Bitter Barbs** - Several players are tethered together and several other players are targeted with a small telegraphed AoE.
    > Tethered players must run away from each other to break the tether, keeping in mind that some exaflares are still travelling across the arena.

5. **Whirling Zantetsuken** or **For Honor** - An untelegraphed donut or PB-AoE respectively.

6. **Spirits of the Fallen**

7. **Cloud to Ground**

8. **Levinwhorl**  - A hefty proximity AoE originating from **Raiden**

9. **Ame-no-Sakahoko**

10. **Whirling Zantetsuken** or **For Honor**

11. **Booming Lament**

12. **Spirits of the Fallen**

13. **Ball Lightning**

14. **Lateral Zantetsuken** and **Lancing Bolt**

If DPS is low, **Raiden** will repeatedly use **Spirits of the Fallen** as a soft enrage until all players are dead.

#### Secret Rooms and Expedition Support

To remove the buff that **Absolute Virtue** has, players inside the raid are required to spawn the Notorious Monster FATE **The Baldesion Arsenal: Expedition Support** and players outside the raid are required to complete it.

To spawn it, players must first discover the secret rooms via a portal in one of the rooms before **Absolute Virtue**. The portal can only be uncovered via the use of **Perception L**.

There are **six** secret rooms, each aspected to an element and each with a button that when all simultaneously pressed, will do the following:

- Spawn the Notorious Monster FATE **The Baldesion Arsenal: Expedition Support**.
- **Lock** the entrance to the room and spawn enemies that must be killed to unlock the entrance.

::: info NOTE
Because the nature of the buff on **Absolute Virtue** only requires that the FATE be spawned and completed, you may opt to **cheese** a room instead. This is done by avoiding combat with the enemies that spawn and instead using **Return** to exit the room **AND** the raid as a whole.
:::

Players outside the raid will need to complete the FATE, granting the **Aetherially Primed** buff to any **Elemental Level 60** players that complete it with a **Gold Rating** and spawning up to **eight** portals that players can use to enter the raid.

::: info The Baldesion Arsenal: Expedition Support
**Dispel L** is required to remove any personal buffs the Notorious Monster gives itself.
:::

#### Boss 3 - Absolute Virtue

**Absolute Virtue** is the first boss in **The Baldesion Arsenal** to introduce a **hard enrage at 7:20**.

**Absolute Virtue** is **Wind** aspected, so adjust your Magia board to **Wind** for defense and **Ice** for offense.

**Absolute Virtue** begins with the opening sequence:

1. **Meteor** - A raidwide

2. **Eidos** - creates **light** or **dark** aspected bracelets that surround its wrists, **augmenting** any future attacks that are of the same element. A buff based on the augmented element will also be visible on the boss.

3. **Hostile Aspect** - Several **light** and **dark** aspected AoEs litter the ground, but **only one** element will be augmented based on the boss's bracelets, suddenly growing in size before the cast finishes.
    > As long as players stand away from the augmented AoEs, the unaugmented AoEs will never grow in size.

4. **Medusa Javelin** - A wide telegraphed conal AoE targeted at a random player.

5. **Eidos**

6. **Impact Stream** - Splits the arena into a **light** and **dark** side. Getting hit by the **augmented** element will result in lethal damage.

7. **Auroral Wind** - A small AoE tankbuster.

8. **Eidos**

9. **Hostile Aspect**

10. **Meteor**

11. **Turbulent Aether** - Several random players are tethered to a **light** or **dark** orb, spawning with a puddle of the same element under each orb.
    > **Tethered players** must run and stand under a puddle of the opposite element before being hit with their orb.

**Absolute Virtue** will repeat a few more attacks before jumping away, becoming untargetable and spawning **three Explosive Impulses**, proximity AoEs along the walls of the arena.

Each **Explosive Impulse** will spawn a clone of **Absolute Virtue**, with **light** or **dark** bracelets already active on them. One by one, they will cast **Impact Stream**, requiring players to be on the unaugmented side of the arena for each cast. To identify which clone is casting **Impact Stream**, players can follow the cut down the middle to a clone.

The next **Explosive Impulse** is player targeted, **Absolute Virtue** will reappear and the fight continues.

The final mechanic of note is **Call Wyvern**, the boss will summon **two Aern's Wynav** adds, both **Lightning** aspected, and must be killed before they cast **Explosion** a hefty raidwide that also inflicts everyon with **Damage Down**

**Absolute Virtue** will repeat all of these mechanics until its **final enrage at 7:20**.

#### Boss 4 - Proto Ozma

**Proto Ozma** is the final boss of **The Baldesion Arsenal**, constantly switching between forms that adjust both its auto attacks and available mechanics.

**Proto Ozma** is **Lightning** aspected, so adjust your Magia board to **Lightning** for defense or **Earth** for offense.

Below is a table with every shape **Proto Ozma** can take, along with the attack it executes after changing shape and the type of auto attacks.

| | **Form Shift** | **Auto Attacks** |
| - | :-: | :-: |
| **Sphere** <br> 🪩 | **Black Hole** - **Six** glowing buttons appear around the arena. Players must be standing on a button to avoid being removed from the raid. Additionally, each button must have at least **one** player on it. | Highest emnity target on each platform |
| **Cube** <br> 🧊 | Donut | Line-AoE at the highest emnity target on each platform |
| **Pyramid** <br> ⚠️ | Large line AoE down the platform | Small bleed AoE at the furthest player on each platform |
| **Star** <br> ⭐ | PB-AoE | Small shared damage AoE on a random player on each platform |

Occasionally, an **Ozmashade** will appear at the back of each platform. Each **Ozmashade** will execute a **Form Shift** that requires players to avoid its attack on top of any existing mechanics that are happening.
