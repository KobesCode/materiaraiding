## Baldesion Arsenal Overview

The Baldesion Arsenal is the only raid available within The Forbidden Land, Eureka, introduced in Stormblood. The raid features multiple bosses and small-scale encounters, requiring a large group of players to complete. The raid is designed for up to 48 players but can be entered with undersized parties should they still meet the entry requirements:
- You must have The Baldesion Arsenal unlocked by **completing all story-based quests** within the zone and speaking with the **Expedition Scholar** in the base camp of Hydatos
- You must be Elemental Level 60
- You must earn a gold rating in the Notorious Monster  FATE **I Don't Want to Believe** to receive the **Aetherially Primed** buff for 10 minutes

From there, you may enter any portals that appear around the map, either by using an **Aetheric Stabilizer** on a blue unstable portal or waiting until the portal stabilises naturally and becomes red in colour.

## Zone Overview

Eureka allows players to progress their character's power in **many different ways**, each serving to help the player in both the multiple zones and inside The Baldesion Arsenal.

They are not strictly required to clear the raid but are generally reccomended if you have lots of gil and/or plan to spend a lot of time in Eureka zones.

### Logos Actions

Logos actions, first introduced in Pyros, allow players to use up to **2 specialised actions** at any time that have various, powerful effects.

To obtain and equip them players must first acquire the neccessary **logograms** which can be dropped by mobs, Notorious Monster FATEs, found in coffers and also purchased off the Marketboard. Afterwards, you can speak with **Drake** to appraise them, and finally combine them at the **Logos Manipulator** to create the actions.

To see a complete table of Logos actions, along with their effects, recipes and logogram aquisitions, please see the website below.

### Aethertight Flasks

Aethertight Flasks are items dropped from **Silver Happy Bunny Coffers only** that serve to increase the amount of Logos action slots available to the player.

**Up to 3** can be used by speaking with the **Expedition Alchemist** in the base camp of Hydatos, for a **maximum of 6** total Logos action slots.

### 6th and 7th Magicites

Certain Notorious Monsters within both Pyros and Hydatos have a **very rare chance** to drop a unique material.

You must obtain one of each unique material availble within each zone and speak with the **Expedition Engineer** located within each base camp to earn your 6th and 7th magicites. You may also purchase these materials off the Marketboard.

Below is a table listing the name of the unique material and the Notorious Monster FATE it drops from.

| **Pyros** | **Hydatos** |
| --- | --- |
| Lamebrix's Dice <br> (**Thirty Whacks**) | Molech's Horn <br> (**Bullheaded Berserker**) |
| Ying Yang's Tissue <br> (**Haunter of the Dark**) | Goldemar's Horn <br> (**Duty-free**) |
| Skoll's Claw <br> (**Heavens' Warg**) | Ceto's Claw <br> (**Stone-cold Killer**) |


### Cassie Earring, Blitzring and Optical Hat

Certain Notorious Monsters within Pagos have a **very rare chance** to drop a piece of gear that increases the player's **Haste** stat, with each point being a **~1% additive increase** in skill speed and spell speed.

Both the Cassie Earring and Blitzring are available as rare drops, whereas the Optical hat can be obtained by collecting an assortment of items across Pagos and crafting them into a singular item, then completing the requisite FATE. All these items are also purchasable on the marketboard.

These items are **extremely rare, expensive and optional** for only a minor increase in damage (if your job directly benefits with more skill/spell speed).

### Elemental +2 Sets and Kirin's Chestpieces

Elemental +2 Sets and Kirin's Chestpieces are obtainable gear that offer substantial increases in universal offense and defense by increasing your **Elemental Bonus** stat.

The Elemental sets are first available from Pyros, and requires players to fulfull **2 conditions** to unlock the **Expedition Artisan**:
1. Obtain an **Elemental weapon**, completed by gathering the requisite materials in each zone.
2. Discover **50 Logos actions**.

The sets can then be augmented in Hydatos, first to +1 with **Hydatos Crystals** and finally to +2 with **Eureka Fragments**, dropped from The Baldesion Arsenal.

Kirin's Chestpieces are available for exchange with the **Nostalgic Fellow** in Kugane using **Cryptic Seals** and **Damascene Cloth**, both obtainable within The Baldesion Arsenal. You may also buy the armor and materials off the Marketboard.

### Physeos Weapons

To upgrade your weapon to a Physeos Weapon, you must exchange both your **final stage** Eureka weapon and **100 Eureka Fragments**, dropped from The Baldesion Arsenal.
