## Forked Tower Overview

Forked Tower is the first raid in the Occult Crescent series, introduced in Dawntrail. It features multiple bosses and puzzles and requires a large group of players to complete. The raid is designed for 48 players and includes unique mechanics that require coordination and teamwork, but parties may enter with as little as 16 players provided they have the requisite **Sanguine Ciphers**.

Forked Tower is part of the **South Horn Field Operation** and will require completing several prerequisites before players can access it.

## Zone Overview & Quests

Occult Crescent: South Horn is the first Field Operation in the Occult Crescent series set in Dawntrail. Field Operations provide a blend of exploration, combat, experimentation and teamwork.

South Horn is unlocked after completing the Dawntrail main story quest and the intro quest "**One Last Hurrah**". A portal to **Phantom Village** leading to **South Horn** can be accessed in Tuliyollal (X:17.1 Y:11.8).

Progression in the zone is a blend of Eureka and Save the Queen, allowing players to farm overworld mobs for chain bonuses, complete FATEs, spawn Critical Encounters (CEs) and discover chests around the zone with the help of pots and bunnies.

### Phantom Jobs

Phantom Jobs are a unique feature of Occult Crescent, allowing players to temporarily take on the abilities and roles of different jobs. Each phantom job has its own set of abilties or traits, unlocked by earning **Phantom Job EXP** and levelling up through FATEs, CEs and Chain bonuses.

Reaching the maximum level on a phantom job will earn you a stack of **Phantom Mastery**, a permament buff increasing your damage dealt and healing potency by **~2%** for each stack, as well as adding 1 level to your Phantom Freelancer.

There are currently **13 phantom jobs** available in South Horn, some are purchased with silver and gold pieces while others are unlocked from various CE drops.

| **Default** <br /> (Starting jobs) | **Silver Pieces** <br /> (1000 per job) | **Gold Pieces** <br /> (1600 per job) | **CE Drop** <br /> (Listed below, not guaranteed) |

<Action title='Detailed Phantom Job Info' color='purple' href='https://lynn.pet/occult/phantomjob' />

### Relic Weapons

Relic weapons are unlocked from a short quest chain with Gerolt in Phantom Village. The quest chain is made up of two steps:

1. A **one-time** quest to gather 3 copies of 6 unique **Demiatmas** (3 copies x 6 types = 18 total).
2. A **repeatable** quest to buy 3 of a material from the nearby vendor with **uncapped tomestones** (1500 uncapped tomestones per weapon).

Demiatma can be obtained from various sources, including:
- Completing FATEs and Critical Encounters in South Horn (See map above)
- Completing FATEs in Dawntrail zones:
	- Azurite / Cyan - **Urqopacha**
	- Verdigris / Blue - **Kozama'uka**
	- Malachite / Green - **Yak'tel**
	- Realgar / Orange - **Shaaloani**
	- Caput Mortuum / Purple - **Heritage Found**
	- Orpiment / Yellow - **Living Memory**

These are **rare** drops and can take some time to farm. Occult Crescent appears to be the fastest way but is harder to focus farm as the Fates spawn randomly.

Once you have the required materials, return to Gerolt in Phantom Village with all 18 demiatmas to complete the **one-time** quest and begin to obtain your relic weapons.

### Arcanaut Sets

Vendors in South Horn sell Arcanaut sets, which is a set of gear designed for players to use in Occult Crescent.

Each item costs 4000 silver pieces. The items are 745 ilvl base and come with a special trait that's only active while in Occult Crescent zones:

- +40 Main Stat (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Mind)
- +1 Special Attribute

Special Attribute scales up damage from all Phantom Job abilities that have "**Scale with item level**" in their tooltip description.

You can upgrade the Arcanaut sets using various upgrade materials purchased from the vendor and obtained from loot chests in the zones. Each upgrade will add another +40 Main Stat and +1 Special Attribute to a gear piece of your choice.

### Entry Requirements

Any player who is **knowledge level 20** and has completed the **Mysteries Abide** quest is able to access the Forked Tower instance.

To instance into the Forked Tower, the current weather in the occult crescent must be **Mirage**.
In general, this occurs within 20-40 minutes (I think it's closer to 30 will need to test) of a fresh instance of the occult crescent.

To check if an instance is "fresh", players can look at other players in the instance to see how much time they have in the instance. (flesh this out)

Once the weather is **Mirage**, and the sky is red, players will be able to submit a **Sanguine Cipher** to the gazebo at the center of the map. (Image here)

It is possible to submit more than one scroll. Doing so will improve your chances of entering the instance if there is more than 48 people. 
Any players who are not accepted into the instance will be refunded their scroll.

These **Sanguine Scrolls** can be purchased from the ___ vendor next to the main aetheryte for 600 silver or 950(?) gold.

::: tip Finding a Group
Two major communities support Field Operations in OCE, the **Content Achievers** Discord covers a wide variety of content including Field Operations, while **Murder of Geese (MOG)** Discord focuses specifically on Field Operations Raids and coordinating groups.

### Set Up

Once all players have entered the instance there will be a total of 6 parties of 8 players. (Depending if people are kicked 
or not, you may be required to invite new people to your party).

As these runs require a vast amount of people, generally there will be a "host" who is the main shot-caller
for the run. Discuss this within the **Content Achievers** discord or the **MOG** discord to ensure you have clear communication from the host.

They will also type any important information into **Yell/Shout** chat, so keep an eye on your chat window.

The host will then assign each party with a name:
- Party A / 1
- Party B / 2 
- Party C / 3
- Party D / 4 
- Party E / 5
- Party F / 6

The common terminology in Materia Datacenter is **ABC123**, which also splits the raid into two groups of Letters and Numbers.

This is important as various mechanics require players to move to certain waymarks. 
To ensure an even split, players must go to the waymark assigned to their group. 

Each party leader will have to communicate with the host of the run
to ensure each group has the adequate Phantom Jobs. As players are only able to change Phantom Jobs within the starting area
this should be organised beforehand.

There are several Phantom Jobs that are required for the Forked Tower raid, these are at minimum:

Per party (A/B/C/1/2/3):
- **1x** Knight (Tank) (or at least 3x Knight Tanks across the entire raid)
- **1x** Bard

Per alliance (ABC/123): 

- **1x** Ranger
- **1x** Thief
- **1x** Geomancer
- **1x** Time Mage

And for the entire raid at least:

- **1x** Berserker
- **1x** Oracle
- **1-2x** Cannoneers (10% MIT & 5% DMG Buff)
