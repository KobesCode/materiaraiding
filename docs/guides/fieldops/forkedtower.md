### Relic Weapons

Relic weapons are unlocked from a short quest chain with Gerolt in the entry zone of Occult Crescent. The quest chain involves a few steps:

- Gather 3 of each **Demiatma** color (3 x 6 colors = 18 total)
- Buy 3x Tome Materials from the vendor in the entry zone (1500 tomestones of aesthetics)

Demiatma can be obtained from various sources, including:
- Completing Fates and Critical Engagements in Occult Crescent (See map above)
- Completing Fates in Dawntrail zones
  - Orange: **Shaolaani**
  - Yellow: **Living Memory**
  - Green: **Yak T'el**
  - Azurite: **Urqopacha**
  - Purple: **Heritage Found**
  - Blue: **Kozama'uka**

These are rare drops can can take some time to farm. Occult Crescent appears to be the fastest way but is harder to focus farm as the Fates spawn randomly.

Once you have the required materials, return to Gerolt in the entry zone to complete the quest and obtain your first relic weapon.

::: tip Note
After the first relic, you will only need to gather the tome materials for each subsequent relic. The Demiatma will not be required again.

### Arcanaught Sets

Vendors in the entry zone of Occult Crescent sell Arcanaught sets, which is a set of gear designed for players to use in Field Operations.

Each item costs 4000 silver pieces. The items are 745 ilvl base and come with a special Occult Crescent trait:

- +40 Main Stat (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Mind)
- +1 Special Attribute

Special Attribute scales up damage from all Phantom Job abilities that "**Scale with item level**" in their tooltip description.

You can upgrade the Arcanaught sets using various upgrade materials purchased from the vendor and obtained from loot chests in the zones.

### Entry Requirements

Any player who is **knowledge level 20** and has completed the **Mysteries Abide** quest is able to access the Forked Tower instance.

To instance into the Forked Tower, the current weather in the occult crescent must be **Mirage**.
In general, this occurs within 20-40 minutes (I think it's closer to 30 will need to test) of a fresh instance of the occult crescent.

To check if an instance is "fresh", players can look at other players in the instance to see how much time they have in the instance. (flesh this out)

Once the weather is **Mirage**, and the sky is red, players will be able to submit a **Sanguine Cipher** to the gazebo at the center of the map. (Image here)

It is possible to submit more than one scroll. Doing so will improve your chances of entering the instance if there is more than 48 people. 
Any players who are not accepted into the instance will be refunded their scroll.

These **Sanguine Scrolls** can be purchased from the ___ vendor next to the main aetheryte for 600 silver or 950(?) gold.

::: tip Finding a Group
Two major communities support Field Operations in OCE, the **Content Achievers** Discord covers a wide variety of content including Field Operations, while **Murder of Geese (MOG)** Discord focuses specifically on Field Operations Raids and coordinating groups.

### Set Up

Once all players have entered the instance there will be a total of 6 parties of 8 players. (Depending if people are kicked 
or not, you may be required to invite new people to your party).

As these runs require a vast amount of people, generally there will be a "host" who is the main shot-caller
for the run. Discuss this within the **Content Achievers** discord or the **MOG** discord to ensure you have clear communication from the host.

They will also type any important information into **Yell/Shout** chat, so keep an eye on your chat window.

The host will then assign each party with a name:
- Party A / 1
- Party B / 2 
- Party C / 3
- Party D / 4 
- Party E / 5
- Party F / 6

This is important as various mechanics require players to move to certain waymarks. 
To ensure an even split, players must go to the waymark assigned to their group. 

Each party leader will have to communicate with the host of the run
to ensure each group has the adequate Phantom Jobs. As players are only able to change Phantom Jobs within the starting area
this should be organised beforehand.

In general (subject to change), each party should have:
- 1 Chemist

And within all 48 players there should be:
- 2 Thieves (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Geomancers (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Rangers (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Time Mages (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
