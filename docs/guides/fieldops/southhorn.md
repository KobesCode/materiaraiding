### Relic Weapons

## Raid: Forked Tower (Juno writeup)

This raid will only appear under **certain weather conditions**, and has a maximum player count of 48.
More blurb here :)

### Entry Requirements

Any player who is **knowledge level 20** and has completed the **Mysteries Abide** quest is able to access the Forked Tower instance.

To instance into the Forked Tower, the current weather in the occult crescent must be **Mirage**.
In general, this occurs within 20-40 minutes (I think it's closer to 30 will need to test) of a fresh instance of the occult crescent.

To check if an instance is "fresh", players can look at other players in the instance to see how much time they have in the instance. (flesh this out)



Once the weather is **Mirage**, and the sky is red, players will be able to submit a **Sanguine Scrolls** to the gazebo at the center of the map. (Image here)

It is possible to submit more than one scroll. Doing so will improve your chances of entering the instance if there is more than 48 people. 
Any players who are not accepted into the instance will be refunded their scroll.

These **Sanguine Scrolls** can be purchased from the ___ vendor next to the main aetheryte for 600 silver or 950(?) gold.

### Set Up

Once all players have entered the instance there will be a total of 6 parties of 8 players. (Depending if people are kicked 
or not, you may be required to invite new people to your party).

As these runs require a vast amount of people, generally there will be a "host" who is the main shot-caller
for the run. Discuss this within the **Content Achievers** discord or the **MOG** discord to ensure you have clear communication from the host.

They will also type any important information into **Yell/Shout** chat, so keep an eye on your chat window.

The host will then assign each party with a name:
- Party A / 1
- Party B / 2 
- Party C / 3
- Party D / 4 
- Party E / 5
- Party F / 6

This is important as various mechanics require players to move to certain waymarks. 
To ensure an even split, players must go to the waymark assigned to their group. 

Each party leader will have to communicate with the host of the run
to ensure each group has the adequate Phantom Jobs. As players are only able to change Phantom Jobs within the starting area
this should be organised beforehand.

In general (subject to change), each party should have:
- 1 Chemist

And within all 48 players there should be:
- 2 Thieves (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Geomancers (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Rangers (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
- 2 Time Mages (1 in group A/B/C, 1 in group D/E/F)
